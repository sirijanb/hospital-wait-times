    <h3>About - The journey behind this platform</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        Emergency departments are often overcrowded, leaving patients unaware
        of long wait times or bed availability. Reports indicate that around 23,746 to 24,000 deaths
        reported while waiting for care in the period of April 2024 - March 2025,
        highlighting the urgent need for better patient flow management.
        This platform enables hospitals to publish real-time operational data
        such as wait times, queue length, and available beds — helping patients
        choose the right facility faster and reducing overall congestion.

Content = "There are several other options for seeking care that includes walk-in and urgent care clinics. They are appropriate for conditions that need same-day attention but are not life-threatening. The hours of operation vary between clinics. Most start between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM and are open until between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM. Most have weekend hours as well. It is important to check the hours of the specific clinic you might be interested in."

Content = "Online wait times and all the dynamic information is updated in near-real time as it is added to the platform by the respective hospital/clinic."
},

{
Title = "Why are the wait times always changing?",
Content = "Emergency demand can change quickly and dramatically. An incident such as a serious car accident can unexpectedly send more people to the Emergency Department and significantly impact wait time."

Title = "Are there days of the week that are busier?",
Content = "Yes. Most Emergency Departments are about 10% busier on Mondays. This may be due to the inability for people to get in touch with their physicians over the weekend. However, it is important to note that any day can be very busy in the ED."
